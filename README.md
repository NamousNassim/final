Depression eroded me slowly until it completely consumed me.
I couldn’t conquer the darkness.
I loathed myself. No matter how hard I tried to revive my fading memories, all I encountered was silence.
If I can’t breathe, I’d rather stop.
I wondered who could be accountable for me.
Only you.
I was utterly isolated.
Saying “I’m going to end it” is easy.
Actually doing it is incredibly hard.
I fought through the difficulty.
I told myself it was just me wanting to escape from everything.
It’s true. I genuinely wanted to flee.
From myself.
From you.
I asked, “Who’s there?” It was me. Again and again.
I asked, “Why do I keep losing my memory?” They said it was my personality. I understand now. It’s all my fault.
I wished someone would see my suffering, but no one did. Naturally, they wouldn’t. They never really knew me.
I wondered why people live. Just because. They live “just because.”
If I asked why people die, they’d likely say they couldn’t endure any longer.
My mind was swamped with troubling thoughts. I never learned how to transform dull pain into pure joy.
Pain is simply pain.
I kept telling myself not to do it.
Why? Why can’t I end my life on my own terms?
I tried to understand the roots of my pain and suffering.
I already knew the answer. I was in pain because of myself. My numerous flaws were the cause.
Teacher, is this what you wanted to hear?
No. I did nothing wrong.
I used to think it was easy for doctors to calmly blame your personality for your suffering.
I’m amazed by the intensity of my pain. People who have suffered more than I seem to carry on just fine. Those weaker than I am also manage to live. I guess not. Among the living, no one suffers more and no one is weaker.
The only advice I received was to “just live nevertheless.”
Asking about the purpose of life countless times isn’t for me. It’s for you.
I wanted to live for myself.
Please don’t speak about things you don’t understand.
How can you ask me to keep searching for reasons behind my pain? I’ve told you repeatedly why I’m suffering. Do I need more reasons to be in pain? More dramatic details in my stories? Even more stories?
I’ve told you already. Were you not listening? Things you can endure and overcome don’t leave scars.
It wasn’t my duty to defy the world.
It wasn’t my destiny to become world-famous.
That’s why it’s said to be difficult to go against the world and become famous. Why did I choose this path? It’s almost amusing now.
It’s a miracle I’ve endured this long.
What more can I say? Just tell me, “well done.”
You did well. Tell me I’ve suffered enough.
Even if you can’t smile right now, don’t send me off with blame.
Well done.
You’ve endured so much.
